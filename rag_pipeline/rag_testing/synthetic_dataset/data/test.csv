Patients who do respond initially, ultimately become resistant to combined therapies, including the currently approved anti-EGFR mAbs.  The overall magnitude of clinical effects observed with anti-EGFR antibodies alone or in combination has been limited, and patients who develop resistance have few treatment options (3-8). The distinct mechanism of action of Sym004 (9), compared to available antiEGFR mAbs, as well as the promising nonclinical and clinical data documenting activity in models (9-11) and patients with mCRC refractory to prior anti-EGFR antibody therapy (13), provide strong support for the trial of Sym004 in combination with FOLFIRI therapy in patients with CRC, who have progressed following first-line therapy, but have not received prior therapy with an EGFR inhibitor.', '<2-hop>\n\n5.2.1 Rationale for Trial Design\nFOLFIRI is a standard chemotherapeutic regimen used in the treatment of patients with mCRC in either the first- or second-line settings. Cetuximab, a chimeric antibody targeting the EGFR, had modest single agent activity in patients with advanced CRC, but increased efficacy was observed when combined with standard combination chemotherapy regimens used to treat this malignancy.  Similar data are available for panitumumab, a human mAb targeting the EGFR.  Given the activity and novel mode of action of Sym004 demonstrated in nonclinical studies and as single agent in early phase clinical trials, further clinical trials are warranted to explore Sym004 in combination with regimens commonly utilized in the treatment of CRC patients.']","The rationale for using Sym004 in combination with FOLFIRI therapy for patients with mCRC stems from the limited efficacy of currently approved anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as cetuximab and panitumumab, which have shown modest activity as single agents but increased efficacy when combined with standard chemotherapy regimens. Sym004 presents a distinct mechanism of action compared to these existing therapies and has demonstrated promising nonclinical and clinical data in patients with mCRC who are refractory to prior anti-EGFR antibody therapy. This combination aims to provide a new treatment option for patients who have progressed following first-line therapy and have not previously received therapy with an EGFR inhibitor.",,,,multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
