**Sym004** is an investigational medicinal product (IMP) that consists of a 1:1 mixture of two humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is designed to target cancer cells and inhibit their growth by inducing internalization and degradation of the EGFR, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation.

## Clinical Trial Context

### Trial Title
An Open-label, Multi-Center Phase 1b/2a Trial Investigating Different Doses of Sym004 in Combination with FOLFIRI in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Progressing after First-Line Therapy.

### Objectives of the Trial
1. **Primary Objective of Dose-Escalation Phase (Phase 1b)**: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Sym004 when administered by intravenous (iv) infusion every second week in combination with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).
2. **Primary Objective of Dose-Expansion Phase (Phase 2a)**: To evaluate the antineoplastic effect of Sym004 when administered at the RP2D in combination with FOLFIRI to patients with locally advanced or metastatic CRC.

### Administration of Sym004
- **Dosage**: Sym004 will be administered in varying doses depending on the cohort assignment, with potential doses including 12 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, and 18 mg/kg, administered every second week.
- **Route**: The drug is given through iv infusion, and the treatment schedule is non-randomized and open-label.
- **Patient Monitoring**: Patients will be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last administration of Sym004.

### Rationale for Use
Sym004 is being investigated due to its potential effectiveness in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have shown resistance to previous anti-EGFR therapies. The trial aims to explore its efficacy in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens like FOLFIRI, particularly in patients who have not previously received anti-EGFR treatment (p. 14, ¶1). 

## Conclusion
Sym004 represents a novel approach in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, particularly for patients who have limited options due to resistance to existing therapies. The ongoing clinical trial seeks to establish its safety, tolerability, and effectiveness in this challenging patient population.","Sym004 is being investigated in a clinical trial that looks at different doses of it in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer that is progressing after first-line therapy.
