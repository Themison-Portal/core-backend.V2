0,Can you tell me what Sym004 is and how it is used in the clinical trial for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer?,"['Sym004 will be administered in combination with FOLFIRI.', 'The binding of Sym004 induces a distinct mechanism of action.', 'The trial includes Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion phases.', 'The expected response rate is projected to be between 32% and 47%.']","# Overview of Sym004

**Sym004** is an investigational medicinal product (IMP) that consists of a **1:1 mixture of two humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)** directed against the **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**. It is formulated as a **5.0 mg/mL solution** provided in clear glass vials with a nominal fill volume of **30 mL**. The product is designed to be administered in combination with **FOLFIRI**, a standard chemotherapy regimen used for treating metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

## Mechanism of Action
Sym004 binds to **non-overlapping epitopes** on domain III of the EGFR, inducing a distinct mechanism of action that promotes the **internalization and degradation** of the EGFR, leading to down-regulation of the receptor and subsequent inhibition of cancer cell growth (p. 20, ¶1).

## Clinical Trial Usage
The clinical trial titled **""An Open-label, Multi-Center Phase 1b/2a Trial Investigating Different Doses of Sym004 in Combination with FOLFIRI in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Progressing after First-Line Therapy""** (Trial ID: Sym004-09) aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sym004 in patients with mCRC who have progressed after first-line therapy. The trial includes:

1. **Dose-Escalation Phase**: To determine the **Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)** and/or **Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)** of Sym004 when administered by intravenous infusion every second week in combination with FOLFIRI.
2. **Dose-Expansion Phase**: To evaluate the **antineoplastic effect** of Sym004 at the RP2D in combination with FOLFIRI (p. 14, ¶1).

### Expected Outcomes
Based on previous studies, it is anticipated that the trial will observe **1-2 patients** with confirmed **Complete Response (CR)** or **Partial Response (PR)**. The expected response rate is projected to be between **32% and 47%** (p. 119, ¶1).

### Administration Details
- **Administration**: Sym004 will be administered in combination with FOLFIRI, with infusions occurring every second week.
- **Preparation**: Sym004 will be diluted in saline prior to administration, with specific volumes depending on the dose (p. 44, ¶1).

## Conclusion
Sym004 represents a promising therapeutic option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, particularly those who have shown resistance to previous anti-EGFR therapies. The ongoing clinical trial aims to further elucidate its efficacy and safety profile in this patient population.","Sym004 is being investigated in a clinical trial that looks at different doses of it in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer that is progressing after first-line therapy.
