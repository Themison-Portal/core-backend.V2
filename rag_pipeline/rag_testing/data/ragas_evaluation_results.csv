## Introduction
The trial titled *An Open-label, Multi-Center Phase 1b/2a Trial Investigating Different Doses of Sym004 in Combination with FOLFIRI in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Progressing after First-Line Therapy* aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sym004, an investigational drug, when used in combination with FOLFIRI, a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who have progressed after first-line therapy (p. 14, ¶1).

## Objectives
1. **Primary Objective of Dose-Escalation Phase (Phase 1b)**: 
   - To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Sym004 administered via intravenous infusion every second week alongside FOLFIRI (p. 14, ¶1).

2. **Primary Objective of Dose-Expansion Phase (Phase 2a)**: 
   - To evaluate the antineoplastic effect of Sym004 at the RP2D in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with locally advanced or metastatic CRC (p. 14, ¶1).

## Trial Design
- **Phases**: The trial consists of two phases: dose-escalation and dose-expansion.
- **Enrollment**: Patients will be sequentially enrolled into dose-escalation cohorts until the MTD and/or RP2D is established, expected by Q4 2016. The dose-expansion phase is anticipated to begin in Q4 2016, with enrollment completion expected by Q2-Q3 2017 (p. 14, ¶1).
- **Endpoints**: 
  - The primary endpoint for the dose-escalation phase is the occurrence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) during Cycle 1. For the dose-expansion phase, the primary endpoint is confirmed objective antitumor response (p. 14, ¶1).

## Background
- **Metastatic Colorectal Cancer**: In 2012, the incidence of CRC was over 1.36 million globally. The five-year survival rate for Stage IV CRC, the target population for this trial, is approximately 12% (p. 19, ¶1).
- **Current Treatments**: FOLFIRI is a standard regimen for mCRC, and the combination of anti-EGFR antibodies like cetuximab with chemotherapy has shown increased efficacy (p. 31, ¶1).

## Rationale for the Trial
- **Sym004's Mechanism**: Preliminary data suggest that Sym004 may have a different mechanism of action and activity in CRC patients who are refractory to cetuximab, indicating potential for improved outcomes in earlier lines of therapy (p. 23, ¶1).
- **Safety Profile**: Previous trials have shown Sym004 to have an acceptable safety profile, similar to other anti-EGFR antibodies, although with some higher incidences of specific toxicities (p. 24, ¶1).

## Conclusion
The trial aims to provide critical data on the safety and efficacy of Sym004 in combination with FOLFIRI, potentially offering a new treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have not responded to prior therapies.

1,Wut iz the significance of a confedential documnt in a clinical trial protocol?,"['The protocol outlines the responsibilities of the Principal Investigator and site staff...', 'It provides clear guidelines on patient selection, withdrawal, and management of adverse events...', 'It ensures that any protocol violations are addressed appropriately...', 'It provides guidelines for the management of adverse events...']","# Significance of Confidential Documents in Clinical Trial Protocols

Confidential documents in clinical trial protocols play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and compliance of the trial. Here are the key points regarding their significance:

## 1. **Protection of Sensitive Information**  
   - Confidentiality safeguards proprietary information related to the trial, including methodologies, data, and results.
   - It prevents unauthorized access to sensitive patient data and trial results, which could compromise the trial's integrity.

## 2. **Compliance with Regulatory Standards**  
   - The protocol must comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and regulatory requirements, ensuring that all trial activities are conducted ethically and legally (p. 4, ¶1).
   - Changes to the protocol require prior approval from the Sponsor and Ethics Committee, ensuring that all modifications are documented and justified (p. 4, ¶1).

## 3. **Guidance for Trial Conduct**  
   - The protocol outlines the responsibilities of the Principal Investigator and site staff, ensuring that everyone involved is aware of their roles and obligations (p. 4, ¶1).
   - It provides clear guidelines on patient selection, withdrawal, and management of adverse events, which are critical for maintaining trial integrity (p. 38, ¶1; p. 118, ¶1).

## 4. **Management of Protocol Deviations**  
   - The protocol specifies how to handle significant deviations and noncompliance, which may lead to patient discontinuation from the trial after discussion with the Sponsor (p. 43, ¶1).
   - It ensures that any protocol violations are addressed appropriately to maintain the trial's validity (p. 43, ¶1).

In summary, the confidentiality of clinical trial protocols is essential for protecting sensitive information, ensuring compliance with regulations, guiding trial conduct, and managing deviations effectively.
