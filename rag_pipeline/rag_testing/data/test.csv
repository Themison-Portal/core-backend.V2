The overall magnitude of clinical effects observed with anti-EGFR antibodies alone or in combination has been limited, and patients who develop resistance have few treatment options (3-8). The distinct mechanism of action of Sym004 (9), compared to available antiEGFR mAbs, as well as the promising nonclinical and clinical data documenting activity in models (9-11) and patients with mCRC refractory to prior anti-EGFR antibody therapy (13), provide strong support for the trial of Sym004 in combination with FOLFIRI therapy in patients with CRC, who have progressed following first-line therapy, but have not received prior therapy with an EGFR inhibitor.']","The limitations of current anti-EGFR therapies in treating metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) include the fact that only a minority of patients with advanced disease respond to the approved antibodies, whether used alone or in combination with chemotherapy.
